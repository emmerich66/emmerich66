-2) Motivation:
  This Project is part of my Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. I decided to use the Boston Project, since I lived in Cambridge for a year during my university time.
  The idea was to find a price prediction for most of the data presentaed by booking. 

  The result ist called Two-Step Bed-Price Zipcode Model.
