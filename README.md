-1) Installations:

     No special installations are necessary, Jupiter Notebook 6.5.4 ist used.

-2) Motivation for the Two-Step Bed-Price Zipcode Model:

    This Project is part of my Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. I decided to use the Boston Project, 
    since I lived in Cambridge for a year during my university time.
    
    The idea was to find a price prediction for most (or representative) of the data presented by Airbnb
    and following the old Real-Estate Wisdom “Location, Location, Location”. 
    The result ist called Two-Step Bed-Price Zipcode Model.
  
-3) File describtion:
  
      The basic data used boston_listing.csv and the notebook Boston_two_step_bedprice_zipcode_model.ipynb are available here.

-4 ) Licencing:
  
    No special licensing is necessary.
